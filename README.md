# Sundry-Scripts
Most of these are teeny tiny scripts to make my life a little bit easier (and me a little bit lazier). Not for really for widespread use. 

Random stuff in here. Added my .bash_profile to maintain my aliases somewhere.

## Scripts

| Script | Use | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| check.sh | ./check.sh num_dollars [num_cents] | Converts numbers to english for writing checks | 
| ssh_linux.sh | ./ssh_linux.sh [server_number] | Initiate ssh login to a UCLA linux server |
