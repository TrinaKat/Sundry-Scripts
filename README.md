# Sundry-Scripts
Random scripts "not important enough to be mentioned individually" - Google

I mostly just wanted alliteration, and "sundry" seemed to be the solution. Tbh didn't know what it meant until I Googled it lol.

Most of these are teeny tiny scripts to make my life a little bit easier (and me a little bit lazier). Not for really for widespread use. 

##Scripts
| Script | Use | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| check.sh | ./check.sh num_dollars [num_cents] | Converts numbers to english for writing checks | 
| ssh_linux.sh | ./ssh_linux.sh [server_number] | Initiate ssh login to a UCLA linux server |
